# MindFlex BCI – EEG-controlled RC car

**English** | [Deutsch](README.de.md)

A brain-computer interface project: a modified MindFlex EEG headset sends its readings through
an Arduino – over USB or wirelessly via Bluetooth LE. A Python application analyses the signals
in real time, trains several machine-learning models on recorded sessions and turns their
predictions into driving commands for a self-designed, 3D-printed RC car with four motors.

Built as the practical part of a school research paper (*Seminarfacharbeit*) on
*“Brain-computer interfaces – how thoughts control machines”*.

## Results

The headset measures with a single electrode on the forehead. That is enough to tell apart
states that show up clearly there – not “thinking left or right”. The car is therefore
controlled with three states you can produce on purpose:

| Command | What you do | Why it works |
|---|---|---|
| STOP | close your eyes | alpha waves rise sharply (Berger effect) |
| FORWARD | open your eyes | alpha drops again |
| BACKWARD | shake your head or clench your jaw | muscle signal picked up by the forehead electrode |

**Accuracy** (one profile, three commands, 12 recordings totalling 285 seconds, evaluated on
held-out whole recordings):

| Method | Accuracy |
|---|---|
| k-nearest neighbours | **85.8 %** |
| Random forest | 85 % |
| Decision tree | 81 % |
| Baseline (always guess the most frequent class) | 48.7 % |

STOP was recognised correctly 90 % of the time, BACKWARD 84 % and FORWARD 81 %. The most common
confusion is FORWARD vs. STOP – mostly right after opening the eyes, because alpha only drops
after 2–3 seconds.

**How it got there:**

- **20 Aug 2026 – apparently 100 %.** The number was a bug: duplicated rows plus a random split
  across overlapping windows. Since then, evaluation holds out whole recordings and always shows
  the baseline next to the accuracy.
- **22 Aug 2026 – 64.6 %** (random forest) vs. a 52.6 % baseline with STOP, FORWARD and LEFT.
  The confusion matrix showed LEFT being systematically mistaken for FORWARD – the forehead
  electrode cannot see the motor cortex. LEFT was dropped.
- **27 Sep 2026 – blind test of the Berger effect.** From the EEG alone, 94.3 % of the seconds
  were correctly classified as eyes open or closed; alpha was three times higher with eyes
  closed.
- **Afterwards** BACKWARD was added via a muscle signal – which produced the numbers above.

These numbers are for one person and a small amount of data. BACKWARD had only two separate
recordings; the application itself warns that its figure is therefore still uncertain. Models
do not transfer between people; everyone needs their own profile.

## Origin and own work

`BrainGrapher/` is based on the open-source
[Processing Brain Grapher](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Processing-Brain-Grapher) by
Eric Mika (MIT licence, see [`BrainGrapher/LICENSE.txt`](BrainGrapher/LICENSE.txt)). It served
as the starting point for reliably receiving and visualising the headset's data. Bluetooth LE
support was added. `BrainGrapher_Python/` is a port of that sketch to Python.

The sketch `mindflex_eeg.ino` is based on the *BrainSerialTest* example of the
[Arduino Brain Library](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Brain), also by Eric Mika.

`MindFlex_BCI_Projekt/` is original work: the data pipeline (validation, ring buffer, feature
extraction), the training and classification system with automatic selection of the best
model, the GUI with calibration and profiles, the Bluetooth link and the RC car control. The
sketch `rc_car_4wd.ino` and the chassis are original work as well.

## Hardware

All components: [parts list](docs/TEILELISTE.md). Wiring:

![Wiring: headset with Arduino Uno, car with Duemilanove and L293D shield](docs/images/wiring.svg)

1. **Headset and EEG Arduino (Uno):** The MindFlex contains NeuroSky's TGAM module. Two wires
   are soldered to its T pin and GND and lead to the Arduino. Using the
   [Arduino Brain Library](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Brain), the Uno outputs one CSV line
   per second (SignalQuality, Attention, Meditation, Delta, Theta, LowAlpha, HighAlpha, LowBeta,
   HighBeta, LowGamma, HighGamma) – over USB or a BLE module. Arduino and radio sit directly on
   the headset, powered by a switched 9 V battery.

2. **RC car (Arduino Duemilanove):** receives single-character commands (`F`/`B`/`L`/`R`/`S`)
   over Bluetooth LE and drives four motors through an L293D motor shield. It steers like a
   tank: to turn, the two sides run in opposite directions. Power comes from a 9 V battery
   that sits inside the chassis below the Arduino.

The chassis is included as [`hardware/chassis_car.stl`](hardware/chassis_car.stl) and can be
printed directly.

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.12, the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) with the
[Arduino Brain Library](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Brain) and the Adafruit Motor Shield
Library v1, optionally [Processing](https://processing.org/download) for `BrainGrapher/`.

1. Upload `MindFlex_BCI_Projekt/arduino/mindflex_eeg/mindflex_eeg.ino` to the EEG Arduino and
   `MindFlex_BCI_Projekt/arduino/rc_car_4wd/rc_car_4wd.ino` to the car's Arduino.
2. Start the Python application:

```bash
cd MindFlex_BCI_Projekt
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

On a Mac you can also double-click `start.command`, on Windows `start.bat`. Setting up
Bluetooth, creating a profile and calibrating are described (in German) in
[`MindFlex_BCI_Projekt/README.md`](MindFlex_BCI_Projekt/README.md).

For signal visualisation only, open `BrainGrapher/BrainGrapher.pde` in the Processing IDE
(requires the ControlP5 library, available via *Sketch → Import Library → Add Library*).

## Data flow

## Privacy

Training profiles and EEG recordings of test participants are not part of this repository.
Everyone creates and calibrates their own profile in the application; the data stays local in
the `profile/` folder.
